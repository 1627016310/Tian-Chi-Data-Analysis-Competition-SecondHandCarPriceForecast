Based on machine learning method, a good used car price forecasting model is established.Three linear regression models (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso) and random forest nonlinear regression model are used to predict the transaction price of second-hand car, and the four most important characteristics affecting the transaction price are used_ time, not repaired damage, kilometer and power_ bin.Comparing the linear model with the nonlinear model, it was concluded that the most suitable model is the random forest regression model, which provides a good price guidance for the second-hand car market transactions, and contributes to regulate the second-hand car market and protects the rights and interests of consumers.
